# Changelog

All notable changes to Dockfin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versioning: `X.Y.Z` where **Y and Z are single digits 0–9**.
After `1.0.9` the next release is `1.1.0`; after `1.9.9` it is `2.0.0`.
Git tag, GitHub Release, and Docker image tags always share the same `X.Y.Z` (via GitHub Actions on push to `main`).
